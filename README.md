# Comprehensive Automated Server Log Analysis and Reporting Script with OpenAI

This Python script offers a fully automated solution for server log collection, cybersecurity analysis, and PDF reporting. It securely connects to your Linux-based server via SSH using the paramiko library to collect critical logs, including MariaDB logs, authentication logs, system logs, firewall logs, and web server logs (Apache and Nginx). The collected logs are then sent to OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model for deep analysis, uncovering potential threats like brute-force attacks, SQL injections, and unauthorized access attempts.

The script uses FPDF to generate a professional PDF report summarizing the findings and delivers it via SMTP email to designated recipients. With cron job integration, this script ensures daily log analysis and reporting, helping administrators stay proactive about their server security posture.
